    <p>The GHS Pride Detector can be seperated into the frontend and the backend. The backend is the model that detects Granada colors, and the frontend is the webpage that displays these results. The model was created and trained using a web application called "Teachable Machine". It is trained to sort an image into one of two categories based on how much Granada colors or logos are present. Unlike the model, the webpage is everything that you are able to see including the text, navigation bar, and buttons. It was created using coding languages such as HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript.</p>
